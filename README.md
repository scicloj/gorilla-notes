# gorilla-notes

This small library offers a basic Clojure REPL workflow for creating visual notes (code + html result).

It is planned to serve as a rendering engine for [Notespace](https://github.com/scicloj/notespace).

We render the notes using [gorilla-ui](https://github.com/pink-gorilla/gorilla-ui). Gorilla-ui is a Clojure library used in [pink-gorilla](https://pink-gorilla.github.io) for rendering visual elements using an superset of the [Hiccup format](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup). It offers declarative Hiccup-like wrappers for various Javascript visualization libraries.
