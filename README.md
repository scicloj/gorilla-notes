# gorilla-notes

This small library is an experiment with a basic Clojure REPL workflow for creating visual notes (code + html result).

We render the notes using [gorilla-ui](https://github.com/pink-gorilla/gorilla-ui). Gorilla-ui is a Clojure library used in [pink-gorilla](https://pink-gorilla.github.io) for rendering visual elements using an superset of the [Hiccup format](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup). It offers declarative Hiccup-like wrappers for various Javascript visualization libraries.

Eventually, some of the attempts here might be merged into [Notespace](https://github.com/scicloj/notespace).

Things are still expected experimental and expected to break across versions.
